<h2>Ingredients - Macarons</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 ¾ cups powdered sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup almond flour, finely ground</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
  <li>3 egg whites, at room temperature</li>
  <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2 drops gel food coloring</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients - Butter cream</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
  <li>3 cups powdered sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make the macarons: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the powdered
    sugar, almond flour, and ½ teaspoon of salt, and process on low speed, until
    extra fine. Sift the almond flour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a
    large bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and the remaining ½ teaspoon
    of salt with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the
    granulated sugar until fully incorporated. Continue to beat until stiff
    peaks form (you should be able to turn the bowl upside down without anything
    falling out).
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the vanilla and beat until incorporated. Add the food coloring and beat
    until just combined.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add about ⅓ of the sifted almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg
    whites and use a spatula to gently fold until combined. After the last
    addition of almond flour, continue to fold slowly until the batter falls
    into ribbons and you can make a figure 8 while holding the spatula up.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a round tip.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet, and
    place a piece of parchment paper over it, using the batter to help adhere
    the parchment to the baking sheet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper in 1½-inch (3-cm) circles,
    spacing at least 1-inch (2-cm) apart.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tap the baking sheet on a flat surface 5 times to release any air bubbles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Let the macarons sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until dry
    to the touch.
  </li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).</li>
  <li>
    Bake the macarons for 17 minutes, until the feet are well-risen and the
    macarons don’t stick to the parchment paper.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer the macarons to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make the buttercream: In a large bowl, add the butter and beat with a mixer
    for 1 minute until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat
    until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. Add the
    cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat to combine, until desired
    consistency is reached.
  </li>
  <li>Transfer the buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a round tip.</li>
  <li>
    Add a dollop of buttercream to one macaron shell. Top it with another
    macaron shell to create a sandwich. Repeat with remaining macaron shells and
    buttercream.
  </li>
  <li>Place in an airtight container for 24 hours to “bloom”.</li>
</ol>
